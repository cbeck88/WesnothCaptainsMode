Data types: Schedule is an array of "Picks". A pick consists of a field saying who it is for, whether it is
ban or pick, and its x, y coordinates on the map.

Unit Pool is a collection of unit types which are eligible. How to popluate this automatically?

Event logic: (with dialogs?)

Start of each turn: If no picks made yet, then first player selects a map pool.
Otherwise, check if next pick is for the the current player. 

If so initiate a PICK dialog, informing the player that it is their pick turn and what type it is. Afterwards, remove this unit, increment the pick counter, and if it was a pick add it to their list...


Event logic: (with built in recruit dialog)

- Leader has keep with one recruit hex and 1,000,000 gold.
- On Prestart, label the map : 1: P1 ban, 2: P2 ban, 3: P3 pick, initialize pick list and counter variable
- On turn start: 
	If there are still picks to go: 
		If it is not my pick, end turn.
	If there are not still picks to go,
		Signal that picks have ended.
		Set both sides recruits to be the picks arrays they have.
		Query the map pool.
		Prepare an "on end turn end level" event. 
		(This is to make sure the last selection gets seen by opponent.)
- On prerecruit:
	If there are still picks to go:
		The *second unit* is selected, 
			moved to the destination location,
			stone it if it is a ban 
			added to the appropriate pick array if it is a pick and not a ban, 
			and removed from both sides current recruit list.
		The turn is ended.
